# Schema Governance & Migrations

Implements ADR-0019.

## The rule

Production schema is code (`payload.config.ts` + `src/collections/*.ts`).
The only path to a persisted schema change is a migration in
`migrations/`. There is no manual production database editing, ever.

## Day-to-day workflow

```bash
# 1. Change collection field(s) in src/collections/*.ts
# 2. Generate a migration from the diff against a real database:
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://payload:payload@localhost:5432/payload \
PAYLOAD_SECRET=<any value for local generation> \
npm run db:generate -- <short_description>

# 3. Known Payload 3.88 generator quirk — fix the emitted import line.
#    This repo's tsconfig sets verbatimModuleSyntax: true, but the
#    generator emits:
#      import { MigrateUpArgs, MigrateDownArgs, sql } from '@payloadcms/db-postgres'
#    which fails at runtime ("does not provide an export named
#    'MigrateDownArgs'") because those two names are types. Change it to:
#      import type { MigrateDownArgs, MigrateUpArgs } from '@payloadcms/db-postgres'
#      import { sql } from '@payloadcms/db-postgres'
#    This is a one-line fix, required after every `db:generate` run,
#    until this is fixed upstream or this repo's generator template is
#    overridden.

# 4. Apply it locally and confirm it's correct:
npm run db:migrate

# 5. Commit the migration file alongside the schema change in the same PR.
```

## Before your first migration on a fresh database

Payload's postgres adapter (`schemaName: 'payload'` in
`payload.config.ts`) does not create that schema itself — it must already
exist:

```sql
CREATE SCHEMA IF NOT EXISTS payload AUTHORIZATION payload;
```

`docker-compose.yml`'s `postgres` service does this automatically via
`docker/postgres/init/01-create-schema.sql`. CI's migration-gate job does
it as an explicit step. A fresh manual `psql` setup needs to do it too.

## Expand-and-contract

Prefer additive changes across two PRs over a destructive one-step
change: add the new field, backfill/dual-write if needed, migrate readers
to it, then remove the old field in a later, separate migration
(ADR-0019 §21-22). This is why, in this change set, legacy fields like
`Users.tenantID` (capital `ID`, free text) were kept side-by-side with the
new canonical `Users.tenantId` rather than renamed in place.

## Tenant-safety testing (ADR-0019 §84, CT-001–CT-004)

Every migration that touches existing data (not just the initial
empty-database schema) should be tested against a representative fixture
covering:

- multiple tenants with colliding attribute values (same slug, same
  filename, same market code across two different tenants);
- at least one record in each publication state;
- at least one localized and one non-localized record.

Verify after migrating: every record's `tenant` field is unchanged, no
record moved between tenants, and relationships/canonical ids survived.
There is no automated harness for this yet in this repository (the one
migration that exists so far is the initial schema against an empty
database, which carries no tenant-movement risk) — build one alongside
the first migration that changes an existing field.

## CI gate

`.github/workflows/ci.yml`'s `migration-check` job spins up a real
Postgres service container, creates the `payload` schema, and runs
`npm run db:migrate` against every committed migration, followed by
`npm run reconcile`. A migration that doesn't apply cleanly, or that
schema-generation didn't actually produce, fails CI (ADR-0019 §96,
"deployment gate").
