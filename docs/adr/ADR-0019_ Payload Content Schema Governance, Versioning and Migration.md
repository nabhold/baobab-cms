# 1. Context

The Baobab Content Engine will evolve continuously.

Payload collections, globals, fields, relationships, indexes, access policies and editorial workflows will change over time.

This evolution is unavoidable.

Examples include:

- adding market-specific fields;
- introducing localisation;
- changing product-content relationships;
- extending media metadata;
- adding new digital-estate content types;
- renaming fields;
- splitting one collection into several;
- introducing new canonical mappings;
- changing publication workflows;
- evolving event contracts.

In a multi-tenant, independently deployable platform, schema changes are architectural changes when they affect:

- stored content;
- APIs;
- events;
- mappings;
- digital estates;
- migrations;
- tenancy;
- permissions;
- external consumers.

Baobab therefore requires formal schema governance.

---

# 2. Problem Statement

A naïve CMS development process may allow developers to edit collection definitions and deploy immediately.

For example:

```text id="r2u0az"
rename field
deploy
hope content still works
```

or:

```text id="jym32q"
delete collection
create new collection
manually copy records
```

This is unacceptable for Baobab.

Uncontrolled schema change may cause:

- data loss;
- incompatible APIs;
- broken digital estates;
- failed event consumers;
- invalid mappings;
- tenant-specific divergence;
- rollback impossibility;
- undeclared content semantics.

Schema evolution SHALL therefore be treated as a governed engineering process.

---

# 3. Decision

Baobab SHALL adopt **versioned, migration-driven, contract-aware content schema governance** for Payload CMS.

All production-significant schema changes SHALL be:

1. declared;
2. reviewed;
3. migration-aware;
4. tested;
5. contract-compatible;
6. reversible where practical;
7. tenant-neutral;
8. observable after deployment.

---

# 4. Schema Ownership

Payload schema definitions SHALL belong to:

```text id="3ei2jo"
nabhold/baobab-cms
```

The repository SHALL own:

- collections;
- globals;
- fields;
- relationships;
- indexes;
- validation;
- editorial lifecycle;
- access policies;
- local schema migrations.

---

# 5. Shared Contracts

Cross-repository contracts SHALL belong to:

```text id="cmaqvj"
nabhold/shared
```

Examples include:

- canonical identifiers;
- context schemas;
- event schemas;
- mapping schemas;
- API interoperability contracts.

Payload SHALL not redefine incompatible local versions of organisation-wide contracts.

---

# 6. Control Plane Contracts

Payload SHALL consume canonical definitions from the Control Plane where applicable for:

- tenant;
- legal entity;
- digital estate;
- market;
- engine;
- capability;
- context;
- isolation profile.

Payload schema changes SHALL not silently redefine those concepts.

---

# 7. Schema as Code

Production schema SHALL be defined as version-controlled code.

Manual production-only schema edits are prohibited.

---

# 8. No Tenant-Specific Forked Schema

Baobab SHALL prefer one governed schema model with scoped content over per-tenant schema forks.

Prohibited pattern:

```text id="nafm1n"
if tenant == "A":
    add field X

if tenant == "B":
    add field Y
```

unless a separately governed extension architecture explicitly permits it.

---

# 9. Schema Variability

Where tenants require different behaviour, Baobab SHOULD prefer:

- configuration;
- capability binding;
- optional fields;
- reusable blocks;
- policy;
- metadata;
- scoped content;

over code-level tenant forks.

---

# 10. Collection Governance

Every production collection SHALL have a defined purpose.

A collection SHOULD declare:

- authority;
- canonical identity requirement;
- tenancy scope;
- supported context dimensions;
- localisation behaviour;
- publication lifecycle;
- relationship semantics;
- retention expectations.

---

# 11. Global Governance

Payload globals SHALL not automatically mean Baobab platform-global content.

Their effective scope SHALL still comply with ADR-0012 and ADR-0014.

---

# 12. Field Governance

Fields SHALL have defined semantics.

A field SHALL not be added merely because it is convenient for one frontend.

Where possible, fields SHOULD model domain meaning rather than presentation implementation.

---

# 13. Presentation Leakage

Avoid schema such as:

```text id="jt4y82"
homepage_left_column_blue_text
```

Prefer semantic structures such as:

```text id="0dct1v"
hero
call_to_action
feature_list
```

---

# 14. Structured Content

Baobab SHALL favour structured, reusable content over arbitrary frontend blobs.

---

# 15. Flexible Blocks

Flexible content blocks MAY be used.

However, they SHALL remain governed by:

- schema version;
- validation;
- compatibility;
- access;
- migration rules.

---

# 16. Arbitrary JSON

Unbounded arbitrary JSON SHOULD be avoided where stable structured schema can express the domain.

Opaque JSON weakens:

- validation;
- migration;
- API contracts;
- searchability;
- interoperability.

---

# 17. Schema Versioning

The Content Engine SHALL maintain explicit schema/application version history.

Schema changes SHALL be traceable to source-control revisions and migrations.

---

# 18. Migration-First Principle

A schema change affecting persisted production data SHALL include a migration strategy before deployment.

---

# 19. Forward Migration

Forward migration SHALL transform existing state into the new supported schema.

---

# 20. Backward Compatibility

Where rolling or phased deployments are used, schema changes SHOULD remain compatible with the previous application version for the required deployment window.

---

# 21. Expand-and-Contract

Breaking changes SHOULD use an expand-and-contract strategy where practical.

Example:

```text id="m8kx2l"
Step 1:
add new field

Step 2:
write both old + new

Step 3:
migrate historical data

Step 4:
read new field

Step 5:
stop writing old field

Step 6:
remove old field later
```

---

# 22. Field Rename

Direct destructive rename SHOULD be avoided when rolling compatibility matters.

Prefer:

```text id="30nl1u"
add new field
copy values
dual compatibility
deprecate old
remove later
```

---

# 23. Field Deletion

A field SHALL not be removed until:

- consumers are migrated;
- data-retention implications are reviewed;
- migration is complete;
- rollback strategy is understood.

---

# 24. Collection Rename

Collection renames SHALL preserve canonical identity and mappings where semantic identity remains unchanged.

---

# 25. Collection Split

Splitting one collection into several SHALL explicitly define:

- canonical identity rules;
- mapping changes;
- relationship migration;
- event impact;
- API compatibility.

---

# 26. Collection Merge

Merging collections SHALL similarly define how distinct prior identities are handled.

Records SHALL not be silently collapsed.

---

# 27. Canonical Identity Preservation

Schema migration SHALL not create new canonical identity merely because storage representation changes.

---

# 28. Semantic Identity Change

If a migration genuinely changes the semantic meaning of an entity, new canonical identity MAY be required.

This SHALL be explicit.

---

# 29. External Reference Migration

Moving a record between Payload collections or engine instances MAY require new `ExternalReference` records while preserving canonical identity.

---

# 30. Temporal Mapping

Old external mappings SHOULD be retired or temporally closed rather than silently overwritten.

---

# 31. Relationship Migration

Relationship migrations SHALL preserve referential integrity.

---

# 32. Broken Relationship Prevention

A migration SHALL detect missing or invalid related records rather than silently dropping relationships.

---

# 33. Tenant Context Preservation

Every migrated tenant-owned record SHALL preserve correct tenant ownership.

---

# 34. Cross-Tenant Migration Safety

A migration SHALL never accidentally move content between tenants due to:

- missing filter;
- null tenant;
- incorrect join;
- wrong mapping.

---

# 35. Digital Estate Scope Preservation

Migration SHALL preserve digital-estate applicability unless intentionally changing it.

---

# 36. Market Scope Preservation

Market-specific records SHALL retain correct market semantics.

---

# 37. Locale Preservation

Localised content SHALL retain locale identity.

Locale migration SHALL not infer equivalence without explicit rules.

---

# 38. Publication State Preservation

Migration SHALL preserve valid publication state unless the migration explicitly changes lifecycle semantics.

---

# 39. Temporal State Preservation

Effective-from/effective-to semantics SHALL be preserved.

---

# 40. Version History Preservation

Where Payload content versions are retained, migrations SHOULD preserve meaningful history where technically practical.

---

# 41. Audit Preservation

Schema migrations SHALL not erase audit history unless retention policy explicitly allows it.

---

# 42. Migration Idempotency

Migrations SHOULD be idempotent or safely re-runnable where practical.

At minimum, they SHALL detect previously completed state.

---

# 43. Migration Atomicity

Small migrations MAY run transactionally.

Large migrations MAY require resumable phased execution.

The migration design SHALL match operational scale.

---

# 44. Large Data Migrations

Large migrations SHOULD avoid:

- long table locks;
- prolonged service outage;
- unbounded transactions;
- excessive memory consumption.

---

# 45. Online Migration

Where availability requirements justify it, migrations SHOULD support online or rolling execution.

---

# 46. Maintenance Window

Some breaking migrations MAY require a maintenance window.

This SHALL be explicit and planned rather than accidental.

---

# 47. Migration Checkpoints

Long-running migrations SHOULD record progress.

---

# 48. Migration Resume

A failed long-running migration SHOULD be resumable where practical.

---

# 49. Migration Observability

Operators SHOULD see:

- migration name;
- status;
- progress;
- start/end time;
- failure reason;
- affected records.

---

# 50. Pre-Migration Validation

Before destructive migration, the system SHOULD validate:

- database health;
- expected schema;
- content counts;
- mapping integrity;
- storage availability;
- backup readiness.

---

# 51. Post-Migration Validation

After migration, validation SHOULD include:

- content counts;
- tenant distribution;
- mapping integrity;
- broken relationships;
- publication state;
- API compatibility;
- event behaviour.

---

# 52. Backup Before Destructive Migration

Destructive or high-risk migrations SHALL require a verified recovery path.

---

# 53. Rollback

Rollback strategy SHALL be defined before deploying high-risk schema changes.

---

# 54. Code Rollback Versus Data Rollback

The architecture SHALL recognise that:

```text id="yvfcg8"
application rollback
```

and:

```text id="rr37lu"
data rollback
```

are not the same thing.

A previous binary may not understand newly migrated data.

---

# 55. Irreversible Migrations

If a migration is intentionally irreversible, this SHALL be explicitly documented.

---

# 56. Forward-Fix Strategy

Some production failures are safer to resolve through forward fixes than data rollback.

The migration plan SHALL state when this applies.

---

# 57. API Compatibility

Schema change SHALL consider public and internal APIs.

Removing or renaming API fields is a contract change.

---

# 58. API Versioning

Breaking Baobab-facing API changes SHALL follow versioning/deprecation policy.

---

# 59. GraphQL Compatibility

GraphQL schema evolution SHALL also be reviewed for downstream impact.

---

# 60. Digital Estate Compatibility

Digital estates SHALL not be surprised by undeclared content-schema changes.

---

# 61. Contract Tests

Critical digital estates SHOULD run compatibility tests against supported Content Engine contracts.

---

# 62. Event Compatibility

Schema changes affecting canonical events SHALL follow ADR-0018 versioning rules.

---

# 63. Event Field Deletion

Fields SHALL not be removed from event contracts merely because they are removed from Payload collections.

Canonical event evolution is separately governed.

---

# 64. Search Compatibility

Schema changes affecting indexed content SHALL include search migration/reindex strategy where relevant.

---

# 65. Cache Compatibility

Changes affecting resolution output SHOULD trigger appropriate cache invalidation.

---

# 66. Content Resolution Compatibility

Schema changes SHALL preserve or explicitly version ADR-0014 resolution semantics.

---

# 67. Inheritance Policy Change

Changing inheritance policy is a production-significant change even if no database column changes.

---

# 68. Policy Migration

Policy changes SHALL be treated as governed configuration migration.

---

# 69. Role and Permission Changes

Schema changes adding new protected resources SHALL include authorisation policy.

---

# 70. Access Defaults

New collections SHALL default to restrictive access until explicitly authorised.

---

# 71. Sensitive Fields

Adding sensitive fields SHALL trigger security/privacy review where appropriate.

---

# 72. Data Classification

Content fields SHOULD support classification where required by governance.

---

# 73. Data Minimisation

Schemas SHOULD avoid storing data unnecessary for Content Engine responsibility.

---

# 74. No ERP Shadow Tables

Payload schema SHALL not grow into a shadow ERP schema.

---

# 75. No Commerce Shadow Tables

Payload SHALL not recreate Medusa operational models merely for convenience.

---

# 76. Projection Collections

Non-authoritative projections MAY exist.

They SHALL be clearly identified as projections.

---

# 77. Projection Rebuildability

Where practical, projections SHOULD be rebuildable from authoritative sources.

---

# 78. Projection Migration

Projection migrations SHOULD favour rebuild over complicated in-place mutation where safe and economical.

---

# 79. Seed Data

Seed data SHALL be distinguished from tenant production content.

---

# 80. Platform Seed Data

Platform-level seed data MAY include:

- canonical content-type defaults;
- reference taxonomy;
- system configuration.

It SHALL not silently create tenant business content.

---

# 81. Tenant Bootstrap

Tenant bootstrap content SHALL be explicit and idempotent.

---

# 82. Sample Content

Development sample content SHALL not appear in production.

---

# 83. Fixture Governance

Test fixtures SHALL exercise:

- multiple tenants;
- multiple estates;
- multiple markets;
- multiple locales;
- identity mappings.

---

# 84. Migration Testing

Each migration SHALL be tested against representative prior-state fixtures.

---

# 85. Upgrade Testing

CI SHOULD test upgrade from supported prior schema versions where practical.

---

# 86. Downgrade Awareness

Where downgrade is unsupported, this SHALL be explicit.

---

# 87. Production Drift

The system SHALL detect or prevent production schema drift from repository-defined state.

---

# 88. Manual Database Changes

Manual production database modification SHALL be exceptional, auditable and reconciled back into code/migrations.

---

# 89. Schema Authority

Database schema SHALL not be treated as editable runtime configuration.

---

# 90. Migration Naming

Migrations SHALL use deterministic, sequential or otherwise unambiguous naming.

Naming convention SHALL be repository-standard.

---

# 91. Migration Immutability

Applied migrations SHALL not normally be rewritten.

Corrections SHOULD be introduced through new migrations.

---

# 92. Migration Ordering

Migration dependencies SHALL be explicit.

---

# 93. Parallel Development

Conflicting schema migrations from parallel branches SHALL be reconciled before production deployment.

---

# 94. Branch Compatibility

Long-lived branches SHOULD not independently evolve incompatible migration histories.

---

# 95. Release Association

Migrations SHOULD be associated with application releases.

---

# 96. Deployment Gate

Production deployment SHALL fail or stop when required migrations are missing or incompatible.

---

# 97. Migration Execution Authority

Production migrations SHALL run under controlled service/operator authority.

Ordinary CMS editors SHALL not execute database migrations.

---

# 98. Schema Administration UI

Payload Admin SHALL not expose uncontrolled production schema mutation to ordinary users.

---

# 99. Runtime Schema Plugins

Plugins that dynamically alter core production schema SHALL be governed and version-pinned.

---

# 100. Payload Upgrade

Payload framework upgrades SHALL include review of:

- database changes;
- migration semantics;
- plugin compatibility;
- API behaviour;
- Admin UI;
- auth/access behaviour;
- versioning behaviour.

---

# 101. Plugin Upgrade

Plugin upgrades SHALL be treated as supply-chain and schema-risk changes where applicable.

---

# 102. Upstream Compatibility

Baobab SHOULD prefer supported Payload extension points over deep internal patching.

---

# 103. Fork Avoidance

A permanent Payload fork SHALL require a separate ADR.

---

# 104. Dependency Pinning

Production dependencies SHOULD be version-controlled and reproducible.

---

# 105. Schema Documentation

Content types SHOULD have human-readable documentation describing:

- purpose;
- fields;
- scope;
- ownership;
- lifecycle;
- relationships;
- resolution behaviour.

---

# 106. Deprecation

Deprecated fields or collections SHOULD be marked and communicated before removal.

---

# 107. Deprecation Window

Breaking consumer-facing fields SHOULD have an appropriate migration/deprecation window.

---

# 108. Deprecated Data

Deprecation SHALL not automatically destroy historical data.

---

# 109. Data Archival

Old content MAY be archived rather than retained in active collections indefinitely.

---

# 110. Archival Schema

Archived data SHALL remain interpretable.

---

# 111. Exportability

Tenant content SHOULD remain exportable in a form that preserves:

- canonical identity;
- scope;
- locale;
- relationships;
- metadata.

---

# 112. Import Compatibility

Importers SHALL validate source schema version.

---

# 113. Unknown Schema Versions

Unsupported imported schema versions SHALL fail explicitly.

---

# 114. Transformation Registry

Complex import/export transformations SHOULD be versioned.

---

# 115. Schema Hash or Metadata

The system MAY expose schema/version metadata for diagnostics and compatibility checks.

---

# 116. Reconciliation

Schema reconciliation SHALL detect:

- missing expected fields;
- invalid relationships;
- orphan mappings;
- invalid scope values;
- obsolete enum values;
- unsupported legacy structures.

---

# 117. Data Quality

Migration is responsible not only for structural correctness but also for preserving business meaning.

---

# 118. Invalid Legacy Data

Invalid legacy data SHALL not be silently discarded.

It SHOULD be:

- corrected;
- quarantined;
- flagged;
- migrated with explicit exception handling.

---

# 119. Tenant-Specific Legacy Exceptions

Legacy exceptions SHALL be data-driven migration rules where unavoidable.

They SHALL not become permanent tenant-specific schema branches.

---

# 120. Security Review

Migration code SHALL be reviewed for tenant-boundary correctness.

---

# 121. Migration Audit

Significant production migrations SHOULD record:

- version;
- operator/service;
- start;
- completion;
- result;
- affected counts.

---

# 122. Observability

Operational metrics SHOULD expose:

- migration failures;
- pending migrations;
- duration;
- invalid record counts;
- reconciliation failures.

---

# 123. Rejected Alternative: Manual CMS Schema Editing in Production

Rejected because it creates uncontrolled drift.

---

# 124. Rejected Alternative: Tenant-Specific Collections by Default

Rejected because it creates long-term schema fragmentation.

---

# 125. Rejected Alternative: Arbitrary JSON for Everything

Rejected because it weakens validation and evolvability.

---

# 126. Rejected Alternative: Destructive Rename Without Migration

Rejected because consumers and historical data may break.

---

# 127. Rejected Alternative: Payload Schema as Shared Organisation Contract

Rejected.

Payload owns Content Engine implementation schema; cross-repository contracts belong in `nabhold/shared`.

---

# 128. Rejected Alternative: Rewriting Applied Migrations

Rejected because deployment histories become non-reproducible.

---

# 129. Rejected Alternative: Assume Code Rollback Restores Data

Rejected because schema/data changes may be irreversible.

---

# 130. Rejected Alternative: Event Schema Follows Payload Automatically

Rejected because canonical event contracts have independent governance.

---

# 131. Consequences

## 131.1 Positive

This decision provides:

- safer schema evolution;
- reproducible environments;
- tenant-neutral models;
- controlled breaking changes;
- stable digital-estate contracts;
- better recoverability;
- predictable migrations;
- protection against long-term schema fragmentation.

## 131.2 Negative

The architecture introduces:

- migration discipline;
- compatibility testing;
- deprecation processes;
- operational migration tooling;
- more deliberate schema reviews.

These costs are accepted.

---

17. Production drift is prohibited or detected.
18. Ordinary editors do not control database schema.
19. Projection schemas are explicitly non-authoritative.
20. Sample content does not leak into production.
21. New content types declare scope and lifecycle semantics.

# 133. Required Conformance Tests

## CT-001 — Tenant Preservation

Migration preserves tenant ownership for all migrated records.

## CT-002 — Cross-Tenant Safety

A migration cannot move Tenant A content into Tenant B scope.

## CT-003 — Canonical Identity Stability

Collection/field restructuring preserves canonical identity where semantic identity is unchanged.

## CT-004 — Relationship Integrity

Relationships remain valid after migration or failures are explicitly reported.

## CT-005 — Locale Preservation

Localised records retain correct locale after migration.

## CT-006 — Market Preservation

Market-scoped records retain correct market.

## CT-007 — Publication Preservation

Published/draft state migrates correctly.

## CT-008 — Idempotency

A migration designed for rerun does not duplicate or corrupt state.

## CT-009 — Compatibility

Supported prior digital-estate/API clients continue to work during the defined compatibility window.

## CT-010 — Event Compatibility

Schema migration does not silently break supported canonical event contracts.

## CT-011 — Drift Detection

Unapproved production schema changes are detectable.

## CT-012 — Failed Migration

Failure leaves the system in a known recoverable or resumable state.

## CT-013 — Upgrade Path

Representative supported prior schema can be upgraded successfully.

## CT-014 — Invalid Legacy Data

Invalid source data is surfaced rather than silently discarded.

## CT-015 — Access Policy

New protected collections are not accidentally public by default.

---

# 134. Implementation Direction

A suitable repository structure MAY resemble:

```text id="9ycrn7"
src/
└── collections/
└── globals/
└── blocks/
└── fields/
└── access/

migrations/
├── 000001-...

└── contracts/
```

Exact layout is non-normative.

---

# 135. Decision Outcome

Payload schema SHALL evolve as a governed production contract, not as an ad hoc CMS configuration.

The governing model is:

```text id="i8m4gf"
            Schema Change Proposal
                    │
                    ▼

                    │
                    ▼
              Verification
                    │
                    ▼
             Reconciliation
```

The governing rule is:

> **Change schema deliberately, migrate data explicitly, preserve canonical meaning, protect tenant boundaries, and never make production content depend on undocumented database history.**

This allows Payload to evolve without turning every new field, tenant requirement or framework upgrade into an uncontrolled platform compatibility risk.
