# 1. Context

Payload CMS includes its own authentication and administrative capabilities.

Baobab, however, is a multi-engine enterprise platform with:

- multiple tenants;
- multiple legal entities;
- multiple digital estates;
- multiple markets;
- multiple roles;
- multiple engine instances;
- organisation-wide identity and security requirements.

Payload must therefore participate in the platform identity model without becoming a separate enterprise identity authority.

A Payload user account cannot, by itself, define:

- canonical actor identity;
- tenant membership;
- legal-entity membership;
- platform role;
- capability entitlement;
- engine-instance access;
- cross-engine administrative authority.

The Content Engine requires a security model that distinguishes:

```text
Who are you?
```

from:

```text
Which tenant/context are you acting in?
```

and from:

```text
What are you allowed to do there?
```

---

# 2. Problem Statement

A naïve Payload deployment could treat every CMS user as a locally administered independent identity.

That would lead to:

```text
Payload user database
       =
enterprise identity system
```

and potentially:

```text
Payload role
       =
platform role
```

This is insufficient for Baobab because a user may have different authority across:

- tenants;
- legal entities;
- digital estates;
- markets;
- content types;
- capabilities.

For example, one actor may be:

```text
Editor for Digital Estate A
Reviewer for Digital Estate B
No access to Digital Estate C
No commerce administration rights
No platform administration rights
```

The architecture must support such distinctions explicitly.

---

# 3. Decision

Baobab SHALL use a **federated identity and context-bound authorisation model** for Payload CMS.

Canonical user or service identity SHALL originate from the platform-approved identity system.

Payload SHALL maintain only the local representation necessary for Content Engine operation.

Authorisation SHALL be evaluated using:

```text
Actor
+
Tenant
+
Legal Entity
+
Digital Estate
+
Market
+
Capability
+
Role
+
Permission
+
Resource
+
Operation
+
Isolation Profile
```

as applicable.

---

# 4. Authentication Versus Authorisation

Baobab SHALL preserve the distinction:

```text
Authentication
     =
Who is the actor?
```

and:

```text
Authorisation
     =
May the actor perform this operation in this context?
```

Authentication success SHALL NOT imply Content Engine access.

---

# 5. Canonical Actor Identity

Actors SHALL have stable canonical identity independent of Payload.

An actor may be:

- human user;
- service account;
- workload identity;
- automation;
- system principal.

Payload-local user IDs SHALL remain external engine identifiers.

---

# 6. Payload User Is Not Canonical Actor

A Payload user record SHALL represent a Content Engine projection or local runtime identity.

It SHALL NOT replace the canonical actor identity.

Conceptually:

```text
Canonical Actor
      │
      ▼
ExternalReference
      │
      ▼
Payload User
```

---

# 7. Identity Provider

Baobab SHOULD rely on a platform-approved identity provider for enterprise authentication.

The exact identity provider is an implementation decision unless separately governed.

Payload SHALL integrate through standard supported mechanisms where practical.

---

# 8. Local Authentication

Local Payload credentials MAY exist for:

- bootstrap;
- local development;
- break-glass recovery;
- controlled emergency administration.

They SHALL NOT become the ordinary enterprise authentication model.

---

# 9. Single Sign-On

Production editorial administration SHOULD support single sign-on where the platform identity environment provides it.

This allows:

- central account lifecycle;
- stronger authentication;
- consistent access revocation;
- organisational identity governance.

---

# 10. MFA

Privileged administrative access SHOULD require multi-factor authentication where supported by the identity architecture.

---

# 11. Tenant Membership

Tenant membership SHALL be platform-governed.

Payload SHALL not independently conclude that a user belongs to a tenant merely because a local user record contains a tenant field.

Membership claims SHALL originate from trusted identity/context data or approved projections.

---

# 12. Context Selection

A user may be authorised for more than one context.

The administrative experience SHALL make the effective context explicit.

For example:

```text
Actor
   │
   ├── Tenant A / Estate A
   ├── Tenant A / Estate B
   └── Tenant B / Estate X
```

The current context SHALL be unambiguous before protected actions occur.

---

# 13. Context Switching

Context switching SHALL be explicit and authorised.

The user SHALL NOT gain access to another tenant merely by changing:

- query parameter;
- URL;
- request header;
- browser state.

---

# 14. Trusted Context

Effective context SHALL be validated against the actor's authorised bindings.

Payload SHALL not trust arbitrary client assertions.

---

# 15. Role Model

Roles SHALL be context-aware.

A role granted in Tenant A SHALL not automatically apply in Tenant B.

---

# 16. Platform Roles Versus Content Roles

Baobab SHALL distinguish:

```text
Platform Administration
```

from:

```text
Content Administration
```

A Content Engine administrator SHALL not automatically become a Control Plane administrator.

Likewise, a Control Plane operator SHALL not automatically receive editorial authority unless explicitly granted.

---

# 17. Suggested Editorial Roles

The Content Engine MAY support roles equivalent to:

```text
Viewer
Author
Editor
Reviewer
Publisher
Content Administrator
```

Exact naming is implementation-specific.

Their semantics SHALL be governed.

---

# 18. Viewer

A Viewer MAY inspect authorised content but SHALL not mutate it.

---

# 19. Author

An Author MAY create and edit content in an authorised scope.

Publication rights need not be included.

---

# 20. Editor

An Editor MAY modify broader editorial content and manage structured content relationships within an authorised scope.

---

# 21. Reviewer

A Reviewer MAY participate in approval workflows without necessarily having publication authority.

---

# 22. Publisher

A Publisher MAY publish eligible content within an authorised context.

Publishing is a privileged editorial operation.

---

# 23. Content Administrator

A Content Administrator MAY manage Content Engine-specific configuration and user projections within governed limits.

This role SHALL not automatically imply unrestricted platform authority.

---

# 24. Platform Administrator

Platform administration belongs outside the ordinary Payload editorial model.

A platform administrator may have authority over:

- tenants;
- engine instances;
- capability bindings;
- isolation profiles;
- canonical contexts.

Those concerns belong to the Control Plane.

---

# 25. Role Composition

A user MAY possess multiple roles.

Effective permission SHALL be computed from authorised role/capability assignments.

---

# 26. Permission Model

Permissions SHOULD describe operations such as:

```text
read
create
update
delete
review
publish
unpublish
archive
manage_media
manage_navigation
manage_schema
administer_content
```

The exact set SHALL remain contractually governed.

---

# 27. Resource Scope

Permissions SHALL apply to explicit resource scopes.

Examples:

```text
Page
Article
Media
Navigation
ProductContent
Campaign
```

A generic "editor" role SHALL not imply every possible content permission without policy.

---

# 28. Operation Context

Authorisation SHALL evaluate:

```text
actor
resource
operation
context
```

not merely role name.

---

# 29. Default Deny

The Content Engine SHALL use a default-deny authorisation posture.

If an operation cannot be proven authorised, it SHALL be rejected.

---

# 30. Least Privilege

Actors SHALL receive only permissions necessary for their responsibilities.

Convenience SHALL not justify broad cross-tenant or cross-estate rights.

---

# 31. Tenant Isolation

All authorisation SHALL preserve ADR-0012 tenancy rules.

Authorisation cannot widen beyond the actor's valid tenant scope.

---

# 32. Digital Estate Scope

An editor authorised for Digital Estate A SHALL not automatically edit content for Digital Estate B.

---

# 33. Market Scope

Where editorial rights differ by market, permissions SHALL be capable of expressing such restriction.

---

# 34. Locale Scope

Where localisation teams operate separately, rights MAY be restricted to specific locales.

For example:

```text
Actor A:
en-ZA

Actor B:
sw-UG
```

---

# 35. Legal Entity Scope

Where tenants contain multiple legal entities, rights MAY be narrowed to one or more legal entities.

---

# 36. Capability Binding

Access to the Content Engine SHALL depend on valid capability binding where the Control Plane model requires it.

A valid actor and tenant do not imply automatic entitlement to:

```text
content.management
```

or:

```text
content.publish
```

---

# 37. Capability and Role Are Distinct

A capability determines whether a context may consume a platform function.

A role/permission determines what an actor may do within that function.

These concerns SHALL not be collapsed.

---

# 38. Collection Access

Every protected Payload collection SHALL implement access rules for:

- read;
- create;
- update;
- delete.

Additional lifecycle operations SHALL be separately governed.

---

# 39. Field-Level Access

Sensitive fields MAY require field-level access controls.

Examples may include:

- embargo date;
- legal approval;
- publication controls;
- internal notes;
- restricted metadata.

---

# 40. Relationship Access

Authorisation SHALL also validate related records.

An editor SHALL not gain indirect access to restricted content through relationships.

---

# 41. Local API Access

Payload's local/internal API SHALL not become a means of bypassing authorisation.

Server-side code SHALL preserve effective context and policy unless operating under explicitly privileged system authority.

---

# 42. REST and GraphQL

Where exposed, REST and GraphQL access SHALL enforce equivalent authorisation semantics.

Protocol choice SHALL not alter access rights.

---

# 43. Administrative UI

Payload Admin SHALL serve editorial/content administration.

It SHALL NOT become the Baobab platform administration interface.

---

# 44. Administrative UI Context

The Admin UI SHOULD clearly expose:

- current tenant;
- current digital estate where relevant;
- current market where relevant;
- role/capability context.

This reduces accidental cross-context editing.

---

# 45. Cross-Tenant Administration

Cross-tenant editorial administration SHALL require explicit privileged authority.

It SHALL not be enabled by default.

---

# 46. Privileged Operations

Operations such as:

- cross-tenant access;
- schema administration;
- identity projection management;
- content transfer;
- global publication;
- bulk deletion;

SHALL be considered privileged.

---

# 47. Superuser Accounts

Payload-equivalent superusers SHALL be treated as highly privileged platform identities.

They SHALL:

- be minimised;
- be audited;
- not be shared;
- not be used for ordinary editorial work.

---

# 48. Break-Glass Access

The architecture SHOULD provide a governed break-glass mechanism for emergency access.

Such access SHOULD include:

- explicit activation;
- strong authentication;
- short-lived permission where practical;
- audit;
- post-event review.

---

# 49. Shared Accounts

Shared human administrative accounts are prohibited.

Actions SHALL be attributable to individual actors wherever possible.

---

# 50. Service Identities

Automations and integrations SHALL use dedicated service identities.

They SHALL not impersonate human editors through shared credentials.

---

# 51. Workload Identity

Where infrastructure supports workload identity, service authentication SHOULD prefer it over static long-lived credentials.

---

# 52. API Tokens

API tokens SHALL be:

- scoped;
- revocable;
- attributable;
- protected as secrets;
- rotated according to policy.

---

# 53. Long-Lived Tokens

Long-lived broadly privileged tokens SHOULD be avoided.

---

# 54. Token Context

Where tokens carry context claims, claims SHALL be validated.

Client possession of a token SHALL not permit arbitrary context substitution.

---

# 55. Token Audience

Tokens SHOULD be audience-restricted where supported.

A token intended for one engine SHOULD not automatically authenticate to every Baobab engine.

---

# 56. Token Expiry

Access tokens SHOULD be time-limited.

Refresh/session mechanisms SHALL follow identity-provider policy.

---

# 57. Session Security

Administrative sessions SHOULD protect against:

- hijacking;
- fixation;
- cross-site request forgery where relevant;
- unauthorised persistence.

---

# 58. Session Context

If context is stored in a session, switching context SHALL trigger proper revalidation.

---

# 59. Deprovisioning

When an actor loses organisational access, Content Engine access SHALL be revocable centrally.

Payload-local stale identity records SHALL not preserve authority after canonical access is revoked.

---

# 60. Suspended Users

Suspended canonical actors SHALL not continue ordinary Payload access.

---

# 61. Tenant Suspension

Tenant suspension SHALL affect Content Engine access according to Control Plane lifecycle policy.

---

# 62. Identity Projection

Payload MAY maintain a local actor projection.

Conceptually:

```text
ActorProjection
---------------
canonical_actor_id
display_name
email?
status
last_synced_at
```

This SHALL remain non-authoritative.

---

# 63. Sensitive Identity Data

Payload SHALL store only identity attributes necessary for Content Engine operation.

It SHALL not become an unnecessary copy of the enterprise identity directory.

---

# 64. Email Is Not Canonical Identity

Email addresses are mutable.

They SHALL not become canonical actor IDs.

---

# 65. Username Is Not Canonical Identity

Likewise, username or display name SHALL not define canonical actor identity.

---

# 66. Identity Mapping

Payload-local identities SHALL map to canonical actors using the canonical mapping/external-reference model where applicable.

---

# 67. Impersonation

Administrative impersonation, if ever supported, SHALL be strongly governed and auditable.

The actor initiating impersonation SHALL remain visible in audit records.

---

# 68. Delegated Administration

Tenant administrators MAY be allowed to manage editorial access within their authorised tenancy boundaries.

Delegated administration SHALL not permit:

- creation of platform administrators;
- changes to other tenants;
- isolation-profile changes;
- engine-instance changes.

---

# 69. Editorial Workflow

Authorisation SHALL support separation of duties.

For example:

```text
Author
   ↓
Reviewer
   ↓
Publisher
```

where organisational policy requires it.

---

# 70. Self-Approval

Some tenants MAY permit authors to publish their own content.

Others MAY prohibit it.

The workflow SHALL be policy-driven.

---

# 71. High-Risk Content

Certain content classes MAY require stronger approval.

Examples:

- legal notices;
- regulated disclosures;
- investor information;
- high-impact campaign changes.

The security model SHALL support content-type-specific workflow.

---

# 72. Publishing Authority

Publishing SHALL be distinct from editing.

The ability to edit content SHALL not automatically imply publication rights.

---

# 73. Unpublishing Authority

Unpublishing or withdrawing critical content MAY require separate permission.

---

# 74. Deletion Authority

Hard deletion SHALL be more restricted than ordinary editing.

Archive or soft-delete SHOULD be preferred where lifecycle policy requires recoverability.

---

# 75. Media Administration

Media upload and media deletion permissions MAY be separate from general page editing rights.

---

# 76. Product Content Rights

Editorial rights over `ProductContent` SHALL not grant commerce administration authority in Medusa.

---

# 77. Commerce Rights

Medusa product administration SHALL not grant Payload editorial authority unless separately assigned.

---

# 78. Schema Rights

Changing Payload collection schemas or platform configuration SHALL not be an ordinary editorial permission.

Schema governance is addressed further in ADR-0019.

---

# 79. Audit

Every privileged content operation SHOULD record:

- canonical actor;
- tenant;
- legal entity where applicable;
- digital estate;
- market;
- locale where relevant;
- resource;
- operation;
- timestamp;
- correlation ID;
- source;
- outcome.

---

# 80. Authentication Audit

Security-relevant events SHOULD include:

- successful login;
- failed login;
- privilege change;
- context switch where material;
- break-glass activation;
- token creation;
- token revocation.

---

# 81. Audit Immutability

Audit records SHOULD be protected against ordinary editorial modification.

---

# 82. Audit Separation

Editorial users SHALL not be permitted to rewrite audit history merely because they can edit content.

---

# 83. Observability

The system SHOULD expose metrics and alerts for:

- authentication failures;
- denied privileged operations;
- unusual cross-context access attempts;
- repeated tenant mismatches;
- break-glass use;
- service credential failures.

---

# 84. Security Events

Material security events MAY emit canonical security/audit events according to platform contracts.

---

# 85. Error Messages

Authorisation failures SHALL avoid exposing unnecessary information about resources outside the caller's scope.

---

# 86. Enumeration Resistance

Where appropriate, APIs SHOULD avoid revealing whether inaccessible tenant resources exist.

---

# 87. CSRF

Browser-based administrative operations SHALL use appropriate protections against cross-site request forgery where the authentication mechanism requires it.

---

# 88. XSS

Payload-admin and editorial rendering paths SHALL treat untrusted content appropriately.

Rich text does not imply trusted executable code.

---

# 89. Content Sanitisation

Where content may contain HTML or equivalent executable markup, sanitisation and rendering policies SHALL be explicit.

---

# 90. Script Injection

Ordinary editors SHALL not be permitted to inject arbitrary executable script into digital estates unless a dedicated trusted capability explicitly permits it.

---

# 91. Secrets

Secrets SHALL NOT be stored in editorial collections.

Examples include:

- API keys;
- service credentials;
- private keys;
- database passwords.

Secrets belong in approved secret-management systems.

---

# 92. Environment Configuration

Authentication secrets and provider configuration SHALL be injected through deployment/runtime configuration.

They SHALL not be hard-coded into repositories.

---

# 93. Development Environment

Local development MAY use simplified authentication.

However, integration and security tests SHALL exercise multi-actor and multi-tenant scenarios.

---

# 94. Test Actors

Test fixtures SHOULD include at minimum:

```text
Platform administrator
Tenant A administrator
Tenant A editor
Tenant B editor
Read-only actor
Service identity
```

---

# 95. Negative Tests

Security testing SHALL prove not only allowed paths but denied paths.

Examples:

```text
Tenant A editor cannot publish Tenant B page
Editor cannot change schema
Viewer cannot delete media
Service identity cannot access Admin UI
```

---

# 96. Identity Provider Failure

If the identity provider is unavailable, existing valid sessions MAY continue according to security policy.

New privileged access SHALL not silently fall back to insecure local authentication.

---

# 97. Control Plane Failure

Where local authorisation projections are permitted, Payload MAY continue operating temporarily using validated cached policy.

The allowed degradation window SHALL be explicit.

---

# 98. Stale Authorisation Projection

Stale security policy SHALL be treated more cautiously than stale descriptive metadata.

Sensitive operations SHOULD fail closed when authorisation freshness cannot be established.

---

# 99. Role Changes

Role or capability revocation SHOULD propagate promptly.

Security-sensitive cache entries SHALL be invalidated accordingly.

---

# 100. Permission Caching

Permission decisions MAY be cached only where:

- context is included;
- actor is included;
- policy version is included;
- revocation latency is acceptable.

---

# 101. Cross-Region Identity

Regional Payload instances SHALL evaluate equivalent canonical identity and authorisation semantics.

A user SHALL not gain broader rights merely by reaching another region.

---

# 102. Regional Administration

Regional deployment topology SHALL not create separate independent enterprise identity silos.

---

# 103. Data Residency

Identity projections SHALL respect data-minimisation and residency requirements where applicable.

---

# 104. External Contributors

The model MAY support external agencies, contractors or partners.

Such actors SHALL receive narrowly scoped, time-bound access where appropriate.

---

# 105. Temporary Access

Temporary assignments SHOULD support explicit expiry.

---

# 106. Organisation Changes

An actor moving between business units, legal entities or tenants SHALL not retain obsolete Content Engine privileges.

---

# 107. Tenant Offboarding

Tenant offboarding SHALL include:

- user access revocation;
- service-token revocation;
- local projection deactivation;
- administrative-session termination where feasible.

---

# 108. Service Offboarding

When an integration is retired, its service identity SHALL be revoked.

---

# 109. No Hard-Coded Roles Per Organisation

Application code SHALL NOT contain logic such as:

```text
if tenant == "thamami":
    role = publisher
```

or equivalent organisation-specific shortcuts.

Access variation SHALL be configuration and policy driven.

---

# 110. Contract Governance

Cross-repository actor, role, capability and security-context schemas SHALL be governed in `nabhold/shared`.

Payload SHALL consume those contracts rather than defining divergent equivalents.

---

# 111. API Contract

Authorised Baobab-facing APIs SHOULD carry or derive:

- canonical actor;
- canonical context;
- capability;
- correlation ID.

---

# 112. Reconciliation

Identity/access reconciliation SHALL detect:

- unknown local users;
- stale actor projections;
- role assignments referencing retired actors;
- access to inactive tenants;
- expired temporary grants;
- orphaned service identities.

---

# 113. Rejected Alternative: Payload as Enterprise Identity Provider

Rejected.

The CMS is not the platform identity authority.

---

# 114. Rejected Alternative: One Global CMS Role

Rejected because permissions differ by tenant, estate, market and resource.

---

# 115. Rejected Alternative: Payload Admin Equals Platform Admin

Rejected because editorial administration and platform control are separate authority domains.

---

# 116. Rejected Alternative: Email as Identity

Rejected because email addresses change and may not uniquely represent all actor types.

---

# 117. Rejected Alternative: Local Password Accounts as Default Production Authentication

Rejected as the enterprise norm.

Local credentials remain exceptional.

---

# 118. Rejected Alternative: Shared Superuser

Rejected because it destroys accountability and dramatically increases blast radius.

---

# 119. Rejected Alternative: Role Name Alone Determines Access

Rejected because access depends on context, resource and operation.

---

# 120. Rejected Alternative: Trust Caller-Supplied Tenant

Rejected because tenant/context must be validated against actor authority.

---

# 121. Rejected Alternative: Permanent Cross-Tenant Editors

Rejected as the default model.

Cross-tenant access requires explicit privileged assignment.

---

# 122. Consequences

## 122.1 Positive

This decision provides:

- central identity governance;
- tenant-aware administration;
- least privilege;
- clear separation of editorial and platform administration;
- better revocation;
- stronger auditability;
- SSO compatibility;
- service identity governance;
- scalable delegated administration.

## 122.2 Negative

The architecture introduces:

- identity integration;
- local projections;
- policy evaluation;
- contextual administration;
- role/capability management;
- synchronisation requirements;
- more sophisticated testing.

These costs are accepted.

25. Privileged operations are auditable.
26. Role/capability revocation propagates.
27. Organisation-specific permission branches in code are prohibited.
28. Cross-repository identity contracts belong in `nabhold/shared`.

---

# 124. Required Conformance Tests

## CT-001 — Canonical Identity

A Payload user maps to a canonical actor without Payload ID becoming canonical identity.

## CT-002 — Tenant Isolation

Tenant A editor cannot read or mutate Tenant B protected content.

## CT-003 — Estate Isolation

An estate-scoped editor cannot edit another estate without additional authority.

## CT-004 — Role Separation

An Author cannot publish where Publisher permission is required.

## CT-005 — Platform Separation

A Content Administrator cannot alter Control Plane tenant configuration.

## CT-006 — Commerce Separation

Payload editorial rights do not grant Medusa product administration.

## CT-007 — Context Spoofing

Changing a tenant/context parameter does not expand authority.

## CT-008 — Local API Enforcement

Server-side Payload Local API calls preserve access controls unless explicitly privileged.

## CT-009 — GraphQL Enforcement

GraphQL cannot expose content unavailable through equivalent authorised access.

## CT-010 — Relationship Isolation

Relationship traversal cannot reveal inaccessible tenant content.

## CT-011 — Revocation

Removing an actor's entitlement removes Content Engine access within the defined propagation window.

## CT-012 — Service Identity

Service credentials cannot access human administrative functions unless specifically authorised.

## CT-013 — Shared Account Prevention

Administrative actions remain attributable to distinct actor identities.

## CT-014 — Stale Policy

Privileged operations fail safely when required authorisation state is untrustworthy.

## CT-015 — Audit

Privileged publication and administrative operations create actor/context-aware audit records.

# 125. Implementation Direction

A suitable security boundary MAY resemble:

```text
src/
└── baobab/
    ├── identity/
    │   ├── provider/
    │   ├── actors/
    │   ├── projections/

    ├── admin/
    └── security/
```

Exact file layout is non-normative.

The identity/authorisation separation is normative.

---

# 126. Decision Outcome

The Content Engine SHALL participate in Baobab's enterprise security model without becoming a security island.

The governing architecture is:

```text
                    CANONICAL ACTOR
                           │
                           ▼
                    Authentication
                           │
                           ▼
                     Baobab Context
                           │
              ┌────────────┼────────────┐
              │            │            │
              ▼            ▼            ▼
            Tenant      Capability     Role
              │            │            │
              └────────────┼────────────┘
                           ▼
                    Authorisation
                           │
                           ▼
                    Payload Access
                           │
              ┌────────────┼────────────┐
              ▼            ▼            ▼
            Read          Edit        Publish
